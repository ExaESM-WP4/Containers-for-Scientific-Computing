# The container lifecycle

The typical container lifecycle consists of four parts which may be grouped into a part dealing with the [container image](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#what-is-a-container-image) and a part dealing with the [container](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/#what-is-a-container) itself:

- Image:
  - [Specify](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)
  - [Build](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/build/)
  - [Deploy](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/image_management/)
- Container:
  - [Run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)

In a scientific-computing setting, we add two parts:

- Archive
- Reproduce
