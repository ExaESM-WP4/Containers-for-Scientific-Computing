# Introduction

A scientist's responsibility... is reproducible scientific work!

Practical steps towards reproducible research (e.g. Seibold, 2021)
  * get organized!
  * use open source software
  * use version control
  * make your work available

Reproducible research requires a lot of software skills.
But "software skills" are not only valuable in ensuring "reproducible research".

Consider "the lifecycle of a scientific idea" (after Perez, 2017)
  - ...
  - individual exploratory work
  - collaborative developments
  - production runs (HPC, workstation, cloud, ...)
  - publication (reproducibly!)
  - ...

and the stumbling blocks related to software you could and might have already encountered!

Goal of this workshop... accelerate your "scientific productivity" (and scientific work's reproducibility) with container technology!
