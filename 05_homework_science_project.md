# Homework: Minimal science project

_All pre-existing materials you might need are in: [`05_homework_science_project/`](05_homework_science_project/)_

Consider a scientific project that consists of two steps: A _"simulation"_ which produces data, and a _"data analysis"_ which tries to make sense of the data.

## Simulation â€” Running a compiled software which produces data

This could, e.g., be a physical or biological simulation. Here, we'll use a [small program written in Fortran](05_homework_science_project/create_data.F90) which produces a data sets with a sinus-shaped signal and some added noise.

The data look like this:
```
   15.0000000       0.644502997    
   30.0000000       1.54576778    
   45.0000000       2.07850647    
   ...             ...
   330.000000      -1.68714190    
   345.000000      -0.620180488    
   360.000000       9.53099951E-02
```

## Data analysis - Visualize the simulation's data

This could be a script or a set of scripts which produce figures for a publication or reduced data like mean and standard deviations of the input data. Here, we'll use [`gnuplot`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnuplot) to run [a script](05_homework_science_project/plot_data.gp) which plots the sinus-shaped data produced in step A.

The resulting plot looks like this:
```

## Hands-on details

- Use the latest stable Ubuntu LTS container image.

  Hint: Compare the [Docker image tags](https://hub.docker.com/_/ubuntu) with the [Ubuntu releases](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle) and choose the newest Ubuntu Long Term Support (LTS) release.

- First set up the container interactively:

   - Make sure you have the Fortran compiler gfortran (package name is `gfortran`) and Gnuplot (package name `gnuplot-nox`) installed. Installation can be done by running `apt update` and `apt install -y <package1> <package2> ...` in the container.

   - Compile the software using: `gfortran create_data.F90 -o create_data` Then run the software with: `./create data`. To redirect the output into a data file called `data.dat`, use: `./create_data > data.dat`.

   - Plot the data with: `gnuplot -c plot_data.gp "data.dat"`.

- Now write a `Dockerfile` to set up the container up to the point where the data can be created.
  
  Hint: You need to copy the files `create_data.F90` and `plot_data.gp` into the container during the build process.

- Whenever the container is run, the data shall be written to the host file system and the plot shall be generated.
