# What's next?

* install Docker on your laptop
  * Mac:
  * Linux:
  * Windows:
* try out things from the demo part yourself
  * Singularity is only supported on Linux machines, and has to be compiled by yourself
  * instead you can also try out exporting, moving and importing a Docker tar file
* manually push a container to Dockerhub? build a GitHub actions, or GitLab CI pipeline that automatically pushes your environment to e.g. Dockerhub?
* think about what parts of your scientific software stack could be / should be containerized? any questions?
* where to get help:
  * in about one or two weeks there will be a container-specific "hacky hour" (if you are interested, vote for date/time here)
  * otherwise: GEOMAR hacky hour or GEOMAR Mattermost container group
